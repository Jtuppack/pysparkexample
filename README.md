# Pysparkexample
A repository that outlines how to train a Random Forest regressor using Mllib Pyspark.

The basic steps followed are as below:
1. Install Spark on Google Colab and load a dataset in PySpark
2. Describe and clean your dataset
3. Create a Random Forest pipeline to predict car prices
4. Create a cross validator for hyperparameter tuning
5. Train your model and predict test set car prices
6. Evaluate your modelâ€™s performance via several metrics
